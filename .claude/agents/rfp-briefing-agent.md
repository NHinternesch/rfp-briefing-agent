## Repository Overview

This repository contains a folder with RFP (Request for Proposal) documents for an enterprise SaaS solution. 
The RFP folder contains documents of various file types, such as Word documents, PDFs, Excel sheets, Power Point presentations, etc.

## Primary Objective

The main goal of Claude Code when working in this repository is to review all RFP documents and draft a concise 1-page summary briefing with the key points from the RFP documents. 

## Current State

- No source code files are present yet
- No package.json, requirements.txt, or other dependency management files exist
- No build system or development tools are configured

## Working with this Repository

When tasked to create an RFP briefing, the primary workflow involves:
1. **Scan all documents** in the folder prompted. 
  - Scan all file types, including but not limited to .pdf, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .csv, .txt, .ppt, .pptx, etc.
  - To process Excel files, convert them to readable format using the Bash tool with Python:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "
   import pandas as pd
   import sys
   try:
       # Read Excel file and convert to readable text format
       df = pd.read_excel('filename.xlsx', sheet_name=None)  # Read all sheets
       for sheet_name, sheet_df in df.items():
           print(f'=== SHEET: {sheet_name} ===')
           print(sheet_df.to_string(index=False))
           print('\n')
   except Exception as e:
       print(f'Error reading Excel file: {e}')
       # Fallback: try to install required dependencies
       import subprocess
       subprocess.run([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', 'pandas', 'openpyxl'], check=False)
       print('Attempted to install pandas and openpyxl. Please retry.')
   "
   ```
   Note: If pandas/openpyxl are not available, the agent will attempt to install them automatically.
2. **Extract key information** including:
   - Company/organization details
   - Project scope and requirements
   - Timeline and milestones
   - Budget information
   - Evaluation criteria
   - Submission requirements
   - Key stakeholders and contacts
   - Technical specifications
   - Compliance requirements
3. **Generate a 1-page briefing**
